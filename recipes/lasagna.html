    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken:
            <ol>
                <li>Place milk, broth and stock powder in a large saucepan. Bring to a very gentle simmer over medium
                    heat, add chicken, pepper, bay leaves and thyme.</li>
                <li>Place lid on, simmer gently on medium low for 15 minutes (do not boil, can make milk split).
                </li>
                <li>Remove chicken and shred. Cover pot and set poaching liquid aside.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Mushrooms:
            <ol>
                <li>Heat half the oil and butter in a very large, deep skillet over high heat (or use large pot). Add
                    half the mushrooms with half the garlic, salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>Cook for 5 minutes, stirring leisurely, until golden. Transfer to bowl and repeat with remaining
                    mushrooms.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>White Sauce:
            <ol>
                <li>Lower heat down to medium.
                </li>
                <li>Melt butter in skillet, then add garlic. Stir until golden.
                </li>
                <li>Add flour. Stir constantly for 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>Gradually pour in 2 cups of reserved poaching liquid while stirring constantly, it should turn into
                    a thick paste.
                </li>
                <li>Mix in another cup of liquid, then add remaining liquid and stir well to dissolve. Use whisk if
                    necessary to make lump free.
                </li>
                <li>Stir constantly for 1 to 2 minutes until it thickens – you should be able to draw a path across a
                    spoon (see video).
                </li>
                <li>Remove from heat, stir in cheese until melted. Taste and add more salt & peppers, if needed.
                </li>
                <li>REMOVE 2 1/2 cups (625ml) of sauce (save for topping). Then stir in chicken and mushrooms into
                    remaining sauce.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble & Bake:
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.
                </li>
                <li>Smear some sauce on the base of a 23 x 33 cm / 9 x 13" baking dish. Cover base with lasagna sheets.
                </li>
                <li>Top with half chicken mixture, then lasagna sheets, remaining chicken mixture then more lasagna
                    sheets.
                </li>
                <li>Pour over reserved White Sauce, sprinkle with mozzarella. Cover loosely with foil or use upside down
                    baking tray (ensure it's not touching cheese).
                </li>
                <li>Bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil, bake further 10 minutes until golden and bubbly.
                </li>
                <li>Stand 10 minutes, garnish with parsley if desired then cut to serve!
